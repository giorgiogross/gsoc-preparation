# Frontend example
This ReactJS App shows how ReactJS can be used and how the app can be run on a BeagleBone. 
<hr/>
To start the app on your PC simply do <code>npm start</code>. You can access the app afterwards at localhost:8000<br>
If you want to run it on the BegleBone cd to the app's root directory and do <code>node src/server</code>. 
The app will then be available on localhost:9000
