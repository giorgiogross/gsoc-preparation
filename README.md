# gsoc-preparation
Here are my examples, drafts and sketches to get prepared for GSoC. 
I added BeagleBone serial port comunication from user space to check the performace of the termios API when there are many inputs. 
Proving that no I/O is dropped will help me decide how things can be implemented in the GSoC project.

There is also a web server written in NodeJS. I will explore what's possible with NodeJS on the BeagleBone and add a ReactJS 
interface to gain more experience.

Also make sure to cehck out the GSoC cathegory on my Blog: http://www.giorgio-gross.de/blog/index.php/category/gsoc/ <br>
I'll collect ideas and summarize important information related to the project there.
